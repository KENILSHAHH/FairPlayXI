# FairPlayXi: Privacy-Preserving Fantasy Gaming on Aleo

## Introduction
FairPlayXi is a decentralized fantasy gaming platform built on Aleo, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure privacy and fairness. It enables users to create fantasy teams, participate in contests, and track results without revealing sensitive game state information.

## Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Gameplay:** Utilizes Aleo's ZKPs to keep player selections, scores, and rankings confidential.
- **Fair & Secure:** No central authority controls the game logic, ensuring unbiased outcomes.
- **Verifiable Computation:** Game rules and scoring mechanisms are verifiable without exposing individual data.
- **Decentralized Contest Management:** Users can create and join fantasy contests with cryptographic security.

## How It Works
### 1. Team Selection
Users create their fantasy teams privately using Aleoâ€™s encrypted transactions.

### 2. Contest Entry
Players submit their teams to contests, with entry fees and prize pools managed via smart contracts.

### 3. Game Execution
- Match data is processed off-chain.
- ZKPs verify the correctness of scores and rankings without revealing individual stats.

### 4. Results & Payouts
Winners are determined based on ZKPs, and rewards are distributed transparently while keeping user data private.

## Smart Contract Implementation
### **Fantasy Sports Smart Contract**
```leo
program fantasy_sports_11.aleo {

    // A record representing a contest.
    record Contest {
        owner: address,
        contest_id: u64,
        entry_fee: u64,
        prize_pool: u64,
        is_active: bool,
    }

    // A record representing a user's entry in a contest.
    record Entry {
        owner : address,
        contest_id: u64,
        player: address,
        encrypted_team: field, // Team lineup is stored encrypted
        is_winner: bool,
    }

    // Creates a new contest.
    transition create_contest(owner: address, contest_id: u64, entry_fee: u64, prize_pool: u64) -> Contest {
        return Contest {
            owner: owner,
            contest_id: contest_id,
            entry_fee: entry_fee,
            prize_pool: prize_pool,
            is_active: true,
        };
    }

    // Allows a user to enter a contest with an encrypted team lineup.
    transition join_contest(owner: address, contest: Contest, player: address, encrypted_team: field) -> Entry {
        assert(contest.is_active == true);

        return Entry {
            owner: owner,
            contest_id: contest.contest_id,
            player: player,
            encrypted_team: encrypted_team,
            is_winner: false,
        };
    }

    // Resolves a contest and selects a winner.
    transition resolve_winner(owner: address, contest: Contest, winner_entry: Entry) -> Entry {
        assert(self.caller == contest.owner);
        assert(winner_entry.contest_id == contest.contest_id);

        return Entry {
            owner: owner,
            contest_id: contest.contest_id,
            player: winner_entry.player,
            encrypted_team: winner_entry.encrypted_team,
            is_winner: true,
        };
    }

    // Distributes the prize to the winner.
    transition distribute_prize(contest: Contest, winner: Entry) -> Contest {
        assert(self.caller == contest.owner);
        assert(contest.is_active == true);
        assert(winner.is_winner == true);

        return Contest {
            owner: contest.owner,
            contest_id: contest.contest_id,
            entry_fee: contest.entry_fee,
            prize_pool: 0u64, // Prize distributed, pool is now empty
            is_active: false,
        };
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Using ZKPs
- **Data Privacy:** Keeps fantasy team choices and scores hidden from competitors.
- **Cheating Prevention:** Ensures fair play with cryptographic proofs.
- **Trustless Environment:** No reliance on third-party verification.

## Future Roadmap
- **Live Match Updates with ZK Proofs**
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**
- **AI-Based Fantasy Recommendations**

## Conclusion
FairPlayXi brings fairness and privacy to fantasy gaming using Aleo's zero-knowledge proofs. It ensures a secure, transparent, and trustless gaming experience for all participants.
